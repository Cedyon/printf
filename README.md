ALX Software Enginering Printf Team Project
This team project function for the C programming language called _printf. It has been optimized to take various inputs and optional arguments based exactly on how the standard library function printf works. We submitted this as part of the ALX software engineering course requirement for grading.

git clone https://github.com/Cedyon/printf.git
After cloning the repository you will have a folder called printf. In here there will be several files that allow the function to work.
